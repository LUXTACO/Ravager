### <p align="center">ðŸ§¬ Installation ðŸ§¬</p>

<p align="center">
  Install Python: If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org).
  <br><br>
  Install required libraries: The script relies on several external libraries. You can install them using pip, the Python package installer. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
</p>

```python
pip install pystyle art selenium_profiles selenium-injector undetected-browser
```

<p align="center">
  This will install the necessary libraries for running the script.
</p>

### <p align="center">â›‘ How it works â›‘</p>
<p align="center">
    1. The script first imports the required libraries and defines some variables and functions.
    <br><br>
    2. The main() function is called, which displays a banner and prompts the user for input regarding the number of accounts and threads, as well as the choice of browser automation library.
    <br><br>
    3. Based on the user's input, the selenium() function is called for each thread. This function initializes the browser driver (Selenium or Undetected) and starts the browser.
    <br><br>
    4. Within the selenium() function, the script retrieves an email address from a text file, generates a random password and username, and enters the registration information on the Discord registration page using the browser automation library.
    <br><br>
    5. If successful, the script waits for the account creation process to complete and verifies that the account has been successfully created.
    <br><br>
    6. The process continues until the desired number of accounts is generated or an error occurs.
    <br><br>
    7. The generated accounts can then be used for various purposes.
